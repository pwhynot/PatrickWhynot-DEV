          <p>New to the world of web development, I recently completed a 6 month Full Stack coding bootcamp.
            Web development has become a new passion of mine and I am constantly learning and sharping my skills on both the front-end and back-end to ensure I am always ready to jump into any project.
            Before learning to code I spent many years in Video Production wearing many hats and having skills in every stage of production. Cinematography and editing are my strongest
            skills but I'm also well versed in location sound, directing and script writing.

            In additon to my coding and video skills I also have experience in sales, basic computer knowledge and customer service experience. 
            Additionally I am in the process of building a Film and TV review site called Reel Review, which I hope to offically launch in 2020. Reel Review is a site
            that allows users to sign up for an account and write their own reviews for any film or television show. The site also contains news articles related to entertainment
            and weekly postings by myself and a couple other writers.
